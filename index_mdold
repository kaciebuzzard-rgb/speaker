  <h2>The Waiting Rooms of My Life</h2>
  <p>Selected excerpts from my memoir-in-progress—about caregiving, resilience, and the rooms that change us.</p>

  <blockquote>
    I have learned more about myself in waiting rooms than anywhere else in my life. They are places where identity dissolves and survival quietly reshapes you.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Caregiving is not a moment of crisis. It is a long negotiation between love, endurance, and systems never designed for you to survive them.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Time moves forward. Trauma does not. The hallway changes. The fear remembers.
  </blockquote>
